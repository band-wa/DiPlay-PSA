# Test checklist

Use the [installation guide](INSTALL.md). With the car parked, verify wired and wireless connection, picture, touch and music. Test disconnect/reconnect, then settings Apply/Cancel. Save a diagnostic report after reproducing an issue.

For channel memory, connect until authenticated CarPlay renders, disconnect and reconnect without changing the car's Wi-Fi association. Look for `remembered saved` followed by `remembered first`. Report absent events; creating a hotspot alone is insufficient.

Include head-unit model, DiLink/Android, iPhone/iOS, wired/wireless, app version and exact steps. Do not post credentials or unreviewed personal information. See [compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md) for remaining limitations.


## Preferred Wi-Fi Direct channel

- In **Settings → Connection setup → Wi-Fi Direct**, confirm **Preferred channel: Auto** on a fresh install. Select channel 149 and Cancel; Auto must remain selected. Select 149 and Save, reopen the chooser and restart the app to confirm it stays saved.
- Disconnect/reconnect after saving. Check `channel preference=149 frequencyMHz=5745`, `create mode=PREFERRED_CHANNEL`, and `requestedMHz=5745 actualMHz=5745 matched=true`. An unsupported channel or a different actual channel must report an error instead of silently falling back. Select Auto to restore automatic startup.
- Compare Auto and manual choices with the car already joined to Wi-Fi. A manual choice must override station alignment and any remembered automatic channel. Successful manual sessions must not replace the remembered automatic configuration.
- Switch to built-in hotspot and USB. The channel chooser must be hidden for built-in hotspot, and neither connection may apply the Wi-Fi Direct preference. Returning to Wi-Fi Direct must restore the saved choice. Saving a channel during a connection must leave that session running and apply the change to the next connection.

## Location reporting

With the car parked, open **Settings → Location → Report location to iPhone**.


- On a fresh installation, the switch is off. Enabling it requests precise location if needed; denying the request or granting only approximate location leaves it off.
- Grant precise location, enable the switch, then reopen Settings to confirm the saved state. With no connection running, the setting applies to the next connection.
- During wired and wireless CarPlay, enabling or disabling the switch reconnects the session. When enabled and requested by the iPhone, check for `start-location-information` and `location-information` in the DiPlay diagnostics; on wireless, also verify that reporting continues after the Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi handoff.
- Disable the switch and confirm the next session does not advertise location reporting. These checks verify the accessory reporting path; they do not establish which inputs iOS uses in each fused location result.

## Rotation during reconnect

On an Android device that supports screen rotation, connect until CarPlay renders, then rotate from landscape to portrait and back while the connection is rebuilding. Repeat in both directions, including several quick rotations and a 180-degree turn. Let the device settle after the last rotation and check that the CarPlay picture has the correct aspect ratio and that touch targets match the displayed controls.

In the diagnostic report, the next `Starting CarPlay controller at` and `Display request` must use the latest settled dimensions, including a `Display updated while handshake is reset` event that arrived during teardown. A queued size change must settle before startup; cancelling it by returning to the accepted size must still resume the connection.
 (Use settled display size and startup checks after reconnect)
